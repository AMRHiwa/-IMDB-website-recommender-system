# IMDB-website-recommender-system
In this project, we have built a recommender system. The data is related to the movies on the IMDB website. There are two files, one is the list of movies and their genre, and the other is the rating of users to these movies. The results of the codes and their reports are prepared in the Jupiter notebook format.

movies.csv file:

- movieId: Movie ID
- title: title of the movie
- genres: movie genre

rating.csv file:

- userId: User ID
- movieId: The ID of the movie that the user rated
- rating: the score given by this user to the movie
- timestamp: the exact time of registering the user's points
